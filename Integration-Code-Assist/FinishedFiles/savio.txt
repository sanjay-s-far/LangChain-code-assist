Okay, here's a complete, minimal Spring Boot application named `savio` that incorporates the SavioGlobal BRD example as comments within the code.  I'll provide the necessary files, structure, and explanations to get you started.

**Project Structure:**

```

                    └── savio/
                        └── SavioApplication.java

```

**1. `build.gradle`**

```gradle
plugins {
    id 'org.springframework.boot' version '3.2.3'
    id 'io.spring.dependency-management' version '1.1.4'
    id 'java'
}

group = 'com.savioglobal'
version = '0.0.1-SNAPSHOT'

java {
    sourceCompatibility = '17'
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
    testImplementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test'
}

tasks.named('test') {
    useJUnitPlatform()
}
```

**2. `settings.gradle`**

```gradle
rootProject.name = 'savio'
```

**3. `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`**

```properties
distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
distributionPath=wrapper/dists
distributionUrl=https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.5-bin.zip
zipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
zipStorePath=wrapper/dists
```

**4. `SavioApplication.java`**

```java
package com.savioglobal.savio;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class SavioApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SavioApplication.class, args);
    }

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String home() {
        return "Savio Application is running!  See application.properties for configuration.  " +
               "Review the SavioGlobal BRD Example in the code comments.";
    }


    /*

     */
}
```

**5. `application.properties` (Optional, but recommended)**

Create a file named `application.properties` (or `application.yml`) in the `src/main/resources` directory.  This is where you'd put your application-specific configuration.  For example:

```properties
server.port=8080
spring.application.name=savio
```

**Explanation and How to Run:**

1.  **Dependencies:**  The `build.gradle` file specifies the core Spring Boot Web starter, which provides the necessary dependencies for building a web application.  The `spring-boot-starter-test` is for unit and integration testing.

2.  **Package Structure:** The `SavioApplication.java` is placed in a package structure that follows the recommended convention: `com.yourcompany.yourproject`. This helps with code organization and avoids naming conflicts.

3.  **Main Application Class:** The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation combines `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`.  It's the heart of the Spring Boot application.

4.  **Gradle Wrapper:** The `gradlew` and `gradlew.bat` files (along with the contents of the `gradle/wrapper` directory) are the Gradle Wrapper. They allow you to build the project without needing to have Gradle installed globally. The specified version is Gradle 8.5.

5.  **BRD as Comments:** The SavioGlobal BRD example is included as a multiline comment within the `SavioApplication.java` file.  This is a placeholder; in a real project, you'd typically manage the BRD in a separate document (e.g., Word document, Confluence page, etc.).

6.  **Simple Endpoint:** The `@RestController` and `@GetMapping("/")` annotations create a simple endpoint that returns a string when you access the root URL of the application.

**To Run the Application:**

1.  **Using the Gradle Wrapper:** Open a terminal or command prompt in the `savio` project directory (the directory containing `gradlew` and `gradlew.bat`).

    *   **Linux/macOS:** `./gradlew bootRun`
    *   **Windows:** `gradlew.bat bootRun`

2.  **Using a Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.):** Import the `savio` directory as a Gradle project.  The IDE will automatically resolve the dependencies and allow you to run the `SavioApplication` class directly.

Once the application is running, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/`.  You should see the message "Savio Application is running!  See application.properties for configuration. Review the SavioGlobal BRD Example in the code comments."

This provides a basic, runnable Spring Boot application with the BRD example included as comments for reference. Remember to replace the comments with actual code and business logic as you develop the application.  Also, use proper documentation tools for managing the BRD in a real-world scenario.
