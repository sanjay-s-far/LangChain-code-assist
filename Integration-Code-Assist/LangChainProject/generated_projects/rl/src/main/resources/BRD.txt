Multi-Function Data Integration and Transformation Application
Prepared By: Development Team
Date: July 23, 2025
Version: 1.0

1. Executive Summary
This application is designed to facilitate seamless data exchange and transformation across various systems. It integrates with Google Pub/Sub, PostgreSQL, external APIs, and FTP systems. It also supports XML and JSON data formats and includes basic authentication for secure API access.
2. Business Objectives

Enable real-time messaging via Pub/Sub
Read and write data to PostgreSQL
Consume and expose APIs with basic authentication
Convert and transform data between XML, JSON, and PDF formats
Interface with FTP systems for file operations

3. Functional Requirements
